### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Information and Communication Technology at the University of Trento, Italy, where I also received my MS in Computer Science. I work mainly on large language models for natural language processing and Information Retrieval, but I am also interested in computer vision and constrained generative models.
